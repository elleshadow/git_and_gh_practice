My motivations to change careers boil down to one key thing. i have been coding as a hobby since i was 13. I code in basic, and can do a lot with the Microsoft office suite through VBA. I have also learned quite a lot about databases, and really enjoyed doing work in SQL. I was laid off from my last role, which was mostly a business role with T-mobile, and when faced with the question, "what now" I decided it was time to take my hobby and make it into a career.
